# Snake Project

This project was developed throughout a period of 2 months (Novemember 2022 - January 2023) with a group of 7 students. The learning objectives were primarily focused on management, which explains the comprehensive PDF files in `/documentation`. In addition, programming was the secondary priority of this course and the coding project can be found in `/snake`.

In this course, it was my first time applying cooperative **agile** practices in a team setting. We divided the 10 weeks into sprints, where each sprint is one week. This helped us with montoring our progress in relative to their deadlines. Initially, we coordinated our efforts into divided fields, allowing individuals to become experts in particular domains:

- *Backend (2 indiviuals)*
- *Frontend (2 individuals)*
- *Management (3 individuals)*

Further down the line we switched roles with the intention to ensure all group members understood all aspects covered in the course. To successfully perserve through this change in the pursuit of a cross-functional team, we divided ourselves in pairs and had the expert in their area educate the other person and vice versa. This course was clearly the introduction to **agile** teams and the benefits it can bring if all the members are willing to put in the groundwork of educating and preparing themselves for a new type of environment. For me, the distinguishing factors for this concept is the exchange of information accross members and the planning vs execution in a sprint-based breakdown of a larger deadline. After this project ended, there were many other opportunities for me to harness the concept of **agile** teams and reap its rewards:

## My Contributions

Throughout the course of the project I had two roles. In the first 7 sprints my main focus was on the management aspect and in the 3 last weeks I stepped down as a Project Manager and provided coding contributions. These are the responsibilities that I was tasked with:

- **Project Manager:**
  - Project Report (Documenting & Management)
  - Final Report (Documenting & Management)
  - Allocation of tasks of group members (Management)
  - Monitoring of Progress (Management)

- **Programmer**
  - Songs (UI, switch songs, pause song, duration bar)
  - Playlists (UI, switch playlist, theme-based categorization of songs)

## My most important takeway from this course

To me, the idea of **agile** and diverse yet complementary teams were foreign, before attending this course. The concept of allowing everyone to be a leader, in the sense that acknowledging that the role of a leader is not to know everything and have all of the answers in his mind, but rather assist the team in supportive processes.
