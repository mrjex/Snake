# Snake Project

This project was developed throughout a period of 2 months (Novemember 2022 - January 2023) with a group of 7 students. The learning objectives were primarily focused on management, which explains the comprehensive PDF files in `/documentation`. Furthermore, programming was the secondary priority of this course and the coding project can be found in `/project`.

In this course, the group members applied **agile** practices in a team setting. We divided the 10 weeks into sprints, where each sprint is one week. This helped us with montoring our progress in relative to their deadlines. We coordinated our efforts into divided fields, allowing individuals to become experts in particular domains:

- *Backend (2 indiviuals)*
- *Frontend (2 individuals)*
- *Management (3 individuals)*
