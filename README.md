# Snake Project

This project was developed throughout a period of 2 months (Novemember 2022 - January 2023) with a group of 7 students. The learning objectives were primarily focused on management, which explains the comprehensive PDF files in `/documentation`. Furthermore, programming was the secondary priority of this course and the coding project can be found in `/project`.

We applied *agile* practices in a team setting, and divided the 10 weeks into sprints, where each sprint was one week. This helped us with montoring progress in relative to deadlines. The efforts were coordinates into distinct fields, allowing us to become experts in particular domains:

- *Backend (2 indiviuals)*
- *Frontend (2 individuals)*
- *Management (3 individuals)*
